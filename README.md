This is the code for my web resume which can be found at http://lukedaws.pythonanywhere.com/. I used the Django framework.

There are a few more features and bugs I wish add fix:

bugs
-When removing files via admin it doesn't remove them from the database.

features
-add some animation via CSS
-add a contact page where people can send an email to my gmail.
